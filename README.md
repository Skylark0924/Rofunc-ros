The package is only tested by the following configuration.

1. Ubuntu 20.04
2. Ros Neotic

### Installation

**Please refer to the [installation manual](docs/Installation.md).**

## Functions

### Voice Q&A

For this function, we implemented a Voice Q&A robot based on `ChatGPT`. This function consists of `Speech2text`, `Chat` and `Text2speech`.
