"""A very simple Action Server that does TTS.

It is a combination of a synthesizer and a player. Being an action server, it can be used in two different manners.

1. Play and wait for it to finish
---------------------------------

A user can choose to be blocked until the audio playing is done. This is especially useful in interactive scenarios.

Example::

    rospy.init_node('tts_action_client')
    client = actionlib.SimpleActionClient('tts', SpeechAction)
    client.wait_for_server()
    goal = SpeechGoal()
    goal.text = 'Let me ask you a question, please give me your answer.'
    client.send_goal(goal)
    client.wait_for_result()

    # start listening to a response or waiting for some input to continue the interaction

2. Play and forget
------------------

A user can also choose not to wait::

    rospy.init_node('tts_action_client')
    client = actionlib.SimpleActionClient('tts', SpeechAction)
    client.wait_for_server()
    goal = SpeechGoal()
    goal.text = 'Let me talk, you can to something else in the meanwhile.'
    client.send_goal(goal)

This is useful when the robot wants to do stuff while the audio is being played. For example, a robot may start to
read some instructions and immediately get ready for any input.
